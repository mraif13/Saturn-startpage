Development update: 
- Saturn's codebase and some core parts are currently being completely rewritten, this may take a while so expect less big updates and more bug fixes and smaller changes. A lot of files will be moved around and completely reorganised. 
- **Saturn 7** is expected to have some big design changes to everything including a completely revamp settings experience.

## What's Saturn Startpage?
Saturn Startpage is a fully open source, community build new-tab replacement. **Build with speed and user experience in mind**. Saturn was original build for myself but later on I decided to open source it. This is project is more of a "Learning" process for me, so if you see any messy code or unoptimized code feel free to make a PR, as I said I originally made this for myself. 

## Features:

### Simple by design, but powerful when needed. 
- Everything is straight forward and gets you where you need to go quickly.

### Fast & lightweight & SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDD.......
- Saturn was made with speed in mind, no useless animations or bulky code. Everything loads in a matter of seconds.

### Data? What's that
- Saturn Startpage **DOES NOT** & **never will** collect any data about you.

## Installation on Firefox
- Installation is super easy on **firefox**, just head over to the [release page](https://github.com/mraif13/Saturn-startpage/releases)
- Download the latest version ending with a .xpi extention, it should be under assets. (ex: saturn_startpage-2.6.1.1-an+fx.xpi)
- Updates are automatically applied over the air.
