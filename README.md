# Migration (!IMPORTANT)
- Development has been moved over to Gitlab since I want to learn how to use it. Before each release I have a script that will merge all work done there to here.
- Releases will happen on both Gitlab and Github. However, the update URL will stay on Github for now.

#### Contributor?
- Please make a PR there else you can do it here I will manage :)

## What's Saturn Startpage?
Saturn Startpage is a fully open source, community build new-tab replacement. **Build with speed and user experience in mind**. Saturn was original build for myself but later on I decided to open source it.

## Features:

### Simple by design, but powerful when needed. 
- Everything is straight forward and gets you where you need to go quickly.

### Fast & lightweight
- Saturn was made with speed in mind, no useless animations or bulky code. Everything loads in a matter of seconds.

### Data? What's that
- Saturn Startpage **DOES NOT** collect any data about you.

## Installation on Firefox
- Installation is super easy on **firefox**, just head over to the [release page](https://github.com/mraif13/Saturn-startpage/releases)
- Download the latest version ending with a .xpi extention, it should be under assets. (ex: saturn_startpage-2.6.1.1-an+fx.xpi)
- Updates are automatically applied over the air. 

<sub>Side note: Saturn Startpage isn't dependant on Mozilla's addons store for distribution and updates making the installations process harder, this **will** change in the future.</sub>

## Installation on Chromium base browsers (currently not natively supported)
- Please head over to: [Chromium installation](https://github.com/mraif13/Saturn-startpage/blob/Chromium/info.md)

### Tech used
- HTML, CSS & Javascript. [Plans to move to react are on **hold** atm]
